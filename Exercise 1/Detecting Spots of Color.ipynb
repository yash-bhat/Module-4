The advantage is that this way, labels for a given color center will tend to clusterize together.

By using only 3 dimensions with KMeans, we'd get the same labels for both zones of color. But if we are to use the extra 2 dimensions, there can no longer be 2 zones - the tendency to only have a single cluster of labels of the same kind gets to be big and helps at detecting the dominant zone where the color is the strongest (and has the largest size)."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"_1T9N5u1o8PZ","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["class ImageProcessor(threading.Thread):\n","    '''\n","    Thread-safe class to process a stream of jpeg sequences from a given queue.\n","    '''\n","    def __init__(self, thread_stopper, frames, lock):\n","        '''\n","        thread_stopper -> Is the event which stops the thread when set.\n","        frames -> The queue from which jpeg images come (in numpy.array format).\n","        lock -> Mutex for the queue.\n","        '''\n","        super().__init__()\n","        self.thread_stopper = thread_stopper\n","        self.frames = frames\n","        self.lock = lock\n","        self.incoming = np.empty((240, 320, 3), dtype = np.uint8)\n","        self.processed = np.zeros((240, 320, 3), dtype = np.uint8)\n","        \n","        self.verticals = np.array(80 * [np.arange(0, 60)]).T\n","        self.verticals = self.verticals[:,:,np.newaxis]\n","        \n","        self.horizontals = np.array(60 * [np.arange(0, 80)])\n","        self.horizontals = self.horizontals[:,:,np.newaxis]\n","        \n","    def run(self):\n","        '''\n","        Main thread which runs indefinitely until <<thread_stopper>> event is set.\n","        This function processes each incoming image from the queue iteratively and then displays it in this notebook.\n","        '''\n","        while not thread_stopper.is_set():\n","            try:\n","                self.lock.acquire()\n","                self.incoming = self.frames.get_nowait()\n","                self.position, self.processed = self.dowork(self.incoming)\n","                self.frames.task_done()\n","            except queue.Empty:\n","                continue\n","            finally:\n","                self.lock.release()\n","            showarray(self.processed)\n","            IPython.display.clear_output(wait = True)\n","            \n","    def dowork(self, array):\n","        '''\n","        array -> Is a numpy array that holds the a RGB image.\n","        Function to process an image and detect spots of a given targeted color.\n","        '''\n","        \n","        # down-sizing the image and running KMeans on it\n","        output = array.copy()\n","        array = resizeNPArray(array, 80, 60)\n","        image_and_positions = np.concatenate((array, self.verticals, self.horizontals), axis = 2)\n","        reshaped = image_and_positions.reshape((60 * 80, 5))\n","        kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = 6,\n","                       n_init = 1,\n","                       max_iter = 300,\n","                       precompute_distances = True).fit(reshaped)\n","        rgb_centers = kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0:3]\n","        \n","        labels_rgb = np.empty((4800, 3))\n","        for i in range(6):\n","            labels_rgb[kmeans.labels_ == i] = rgb_centers[i]\n","        labels_rgb = labels_rgb.reshape((60, 80, 3)).astype(np.uint8)\n","        \n","        # getting the closest KMeans center to the targeted color\n","        diff = rgb_centers -
